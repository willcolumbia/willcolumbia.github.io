            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently a senior Computer Science major at the University of South Carolina looking for employment as a Software Engineer. I will be graduating in May of 2024 with a cumulative GPA of 3.30. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently seeking employment as a Software Engineer. I specialize in backend software development with a robust understanding of languages such as C++, Python, Java, Node.js and Django. I am also very proficient in frontend development using languages such as React, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Utilizing these skills I aspire to become a Full Stack Engineer. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I am not programming I love to play sports such as golf, soccer and basketball. I also enjoy activities with my family and friends such as attending sporting events, going bowling, watching movies and so much more.</p>

            <h2>Why Hire Me?</h2>
            <p>Throughout my life I have always been determined and hard working. In Elementary School gym class, I was one of the only kids that was unable to jump rope. I despised the fact that I could not so when I returned home that day, I immediatly ran outside with a jump rope to learn. I was so determined to be the best rope jumper in my class that I stayed outside until the sun went down and my mother forced me to come in for dinner. While this story may sound silly, I believe it showcases how I developed a determined personality at a young age. When faced with a challenge I do not know how to solve, I will work tirlessly to learn and solve the problem. </p>
            <p>Along with being hard working and determined I am a natural born leader. All my life, I have played competative sports. No matter the team I am on, I have always been looked at as a leader of the team and in most cases, been named team captain. I am a firm beleiver that a diverse team can bring all sorts of different ideas and that every idea has a place to be implemented. I am the type of leader that does not point fingers and shout orders, but one that will work along side my teammates to assist and guide towards our goal. </p>
