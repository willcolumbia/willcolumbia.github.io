            <h2>About</h2>

            <h2>What Makes Me a Valuable Addition?</h2>
            <p>Throughout my life, I have always been determined and hardworking. In Elementary School gym class, I was one of the only kids who were unable to jump rope. I despised the fact that I could not, so when I returned home that day, I immediately ran outside with a jump rope to learn. I was so determined to be the best rope jumper in my class that I stayed outside until the sun went down and my mother forced me to come in for dinner. While this story may sound silly, I believe it showcases how I developed a determined personality at a young age.</p>
            <p><span class="focus"> When faced with a challenge I do not know how to solve, I will work tirelessly to learn and solve the problem.</span></p>
            <p>Along with being hardworking and determined, I am a natural-born leader. All my life, I have played competitive sports. No matter the team I am on, I have always been looked at as a leader of the team and in most cases, been named team captain. I am a firm believer that a diverse team can bring all sorts of different ideas and that every idea has a place to be implemented. </p>
            <p><span class="focus">I am the type of leader that does not point fingers and shout orders, but one that will work alongside my teammates to assist and guide towards our goal.</span> </p>
